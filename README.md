## Documentation of Business Card Creation Process

To start off this file, I transformed the vertical cards into horizontal to fix the orientation so it fits my business card. After that, I created the icon container which holds the Instagram icon, the Phone icon, and the Email icon. I used a grid to change the icon container vertically so it fit along the side of my card. After, I created a text container that would add more info to the icons, such as my Instagram handle, my phone number, and my email. After making sure those were in place and looked nice, I had the [Glitch Effect](https://codepen.io/mftaskin/pen/poKGVQq) on hover, so whenever a person would hover over one of the three icons with their cursor, the icon would glitch and change colors a little. To make the icons functional, I included <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mason_gomes5/"> (in this case my instagram link) and it allows users to click on the icon and bring them to my instagram page. After the cards were in place, the background was very plain. To go along with the glitch effects of the card, I went into Adobe After Effects and made a glitch effect to cover the background of the page which rounded off the project.
